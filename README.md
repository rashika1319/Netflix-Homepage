# Netflix-clone
The Netflix Clone project aims to create a web application that mimics the user interface and user experience of the popular streaming service, Netflix. This project will be developed using HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a visually appealing and responsive design. 

Creating a Netflix clone is an engaging project that involves replicating the user interface of the popular streaming platform using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on building a visually appealing and user-friendly web page that mimics the layout and design of Netflix, including a responsive navbar, grid-based content layout, and a dynamic carousel for featured shows and movies. Through this project, I developed skills in front-end web development, enhancing my understanding of responsive design, CSS flexbox, and grid systems to create a seamless and interactive user experience. This project not only demonstrates my ability to implement complex design structures but also showcases my commitment to learning and applying modern web development practices.
